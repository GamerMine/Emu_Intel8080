# Emu_Intel8080
A Space Invader emulator written in C++ with the Qt framework

# Requirements
If you are using the **Windows** version you should install [OpenAL](https://www.openal.org/downloads/).

On **Linux** it should works without any additional steps.

# Installation
- Go into the release section and download the version for you operating system (the **Linux** version has been tested on *Ubuntu 23.10 with X11* window manager)
- Extract the archive and start `run.sh` if on **Linux** or `run.bat` if on **Windows**.
- Enjoy !

# Controls
All the keys are subject to change (currently assigned keys are kind of akward x) )
- Numpad Enter key *(Yes **Numpad**)* to add credits
- & key *(Good luck to find this one)* to start a one player game
- Left and Right arrows to move left or right
- Space to shoot

# Future work
Here are some features I want to add to this project :
- Key binding (reassigning keys)
- i18n (Some translations)
- Some more items in the menu bar (like About, Quit...)
- Possibility to play with a controller (mostly Dualshocks and Xbox controllers)
